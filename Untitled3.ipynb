       "  <Comment: jc.8o5: This coronavirus is the strangest virus I've ever heard of. It's very dangerous the way it spreads. It is so mysterious the way it lurks in schools but then dies at Home Depot. It can wreak havoc in churches; praying people are exceptionally vulnerable! Although it’s mind-boggling how it vanishes when people stand close together holding signs, destroying businesses, homes, property, monuments, etc. Yet, standing to watch a marathon or a concert triggers its wrath.\n",
       "  It is sneaky. It can spread when buying clothes at Kohl's but not at Target. It is non-alcoholic. It can't spread when you are buying beer. It lives for two days on Amazon boxes, you must wait 48 hours to touch them but It can't survive on Dunkin Donuts coffee cups, so enjoying a hot cup of joe is safe. It is the most curious thing, how it lives on basketballs, baseball bats, and ballet bars, but dies on WWE ropes and Walmart shopping carts. It is spread by hairstylists, dog groomers, and dentists, but not by bank tellers, cashiers, and fast-food workers.It's so smart. It won’t bother the first 10 people but it knows when the 11th person shows up so be careful if that’s you. It even knows what you want vs what you need. If you want a massage or your nails done it is very active on the prowl and not even a mask can stop it but If you need a plumber, it is weak, and a mask will keep it away. It also seems to be most dangerous after 5:30pm so businesses must start to close before the virus comes out and wreaks havoc upon the populations. Whoever heard of such a smart sneaky virus?!?],\n",

       "  <Comment: thcarpentershandywork: Out of all the flu's we've had, this has been the biggest leap effort to practice the effectiveness of social media suggestive influence to get a population to get injected by organizations that are supposed to help and keep harmful ingredients out of our food and medicine but looking at some ingredients and warning labels on food, I see cancer warnings and lead warnings. If we were allowed to grow our own food, and if these shady misleading organizations weren't given so much power, maybe we wouldn't be having this problem. Our generation loves information that matches the socially approved narrative regardless of moral questionability. Our generation has been heavily desensitized from taking the life of a child in the mother's womb (previously almost unthinkable) this country used to be seen as a moral nation. Now, whoever has the newest social thinking trend name gets heard even wrong done gets overlooked because it dosn't fit the individual's narrative. The shot though FDA and CDC pave tge red carpet for companies like pfizer that had a lawsuit of more than 2 billion dollars. The biggest in it's history as justice dot gov says. The FDA dosn't compensate the family memebers that die from their shots. They simply do not care about the population. They dont get paid to care. These are the people in charge of injecting foreign fluid into the bodies of people. If our generation strived to live by God's commands, we would fall short but that dosn't mean its wrong, it's the fact that we are not perfect. We are all in need of new hearts and the renewing of our minds . Jesus is the MOST trustworthy with our lives. The gov dosn't care about out broken families, the gov dosn't care that our babies are being butched in the wombs of their mothers. Let's WAKE UP and sit on these matters. Without \"influencers\" or \"leaders\" telling everyone what they think matters. Our t.v.s spout garbage to our children, our teachers preach what the gov tells the board what's approved, our children are being taught they come from primates, they teach that there is no God who loves them, who knows their names and is willing and able to see them through all their pain and turmoil to promises,\n",
